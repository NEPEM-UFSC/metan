# Getting help with metan

Thanks for using metan. Before filing an issue, there are a few places
to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the 
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. If you haven't heard of or used 
reprex before, you're in for a treat! Seriously, reprex will make all of your 
R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to 
ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). For additional reprex
pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of
the tidyverse site.

Armed with your reprex, the next step is to figure out [where to ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask). 

  * If it's a question: start with [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/), 
    and/or StackOverflow. There are more people there to answer questions.  
  * If it's a bug: you're in the right place, file an issue.  
  * If you're not sure: let the community help you figure it out! If your 
    problem _is_ a bug or a feature request, you can easily return here and 
    report it. 

Be
fore opening a new issue, be sure to search [issues](https://github.com/nepem-ufsc/metan/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/nepem-ufsc/metan/pulls) to make sure the 
bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 

Fell free to send an email to <tiagoolivoto@gmail.com> for further questions.

Thanks for your help!
